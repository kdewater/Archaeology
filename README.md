26 August, 2024. This code is associated with a publication that will be updated when the manuscripts are published and available online.

The code was developed in 2024 to project sea level rise and compare sea levels to the elevation of archaeology sites in Maine and Nova Scotia by Katelyn DeWater and Will Kochtitzky at the University of New England. This script requires inputs such as elevation data and site locations that are combined to compare elevations to sea levels. Regretfully, you will not be able to run the script on your own without these specific inputs (see file paths in the jupyter notebook). If you are interested in working with this script on your own, please feel free to contact me (kdewater1511@gmail.com), and I can help you, gladly. I make this script available for complete transparency and bad code is better than no code. I am happy to answer any questions about these scripts.

This repository has 3 scripts:

‘Maine.ipynb’ will find the mean, minimum, and maximum elevations within 5 m of Maine sites. It will then compare these elevations to projected sea levels for 2050 and 2100. 

‘Nova_Scotia.ipynb’ will find the mean, minimum, and maximum elevations within 5 m of Nova Scotia sites. It will then compare these elevations to projected sea levels for 2050 and 2100. 

‘Arc_graphs.ipynb’ will create two graphs, one for Maine sites and one for Nova Scotia sites. The y axis of these graphs are elevation and the x axis are individual sites. Each site has three points of min, mean, and maximum elevation. Horizontal lines indicate current, 2050, and 2100 projected sea levels for visual comparison with site elevation.

I apologize that this code is not commented or well documented, and you will not be able to run it without the file structures that exist on my computer. Many of these scripts were generated with the aid of ChatGPT. However, please reach out, and I am happy to help you with whatever relevant project you may be working on. The script is unlikely to be updated as it is the script for a specific project and will need to be written differently for future projects. If you need to make these types of calculations, it will be much easier to write a script on your own than to use these scripts.
